## Overview 
**Hate Speech Taxonomy** is an ongoing research project that focuses on developing a structured framework for classifying and analyzing hate speech. The goal is to create a consistent taxonomy that supports comparative studies across datasets, languages, and online platforms. 

This work involves iterative data collection, annotation, and taxonomy refinement â€” guided by current academic and regulatory frameworks related to online content moderation. The project is still in progress, and preliminary results are being evaluated. 

Due to the ongoing nature of the study and the paper not yet being published, detailed findings are not publicly shared at this stage.
