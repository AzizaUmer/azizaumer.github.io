## Overview
**Decolonizing AI Toolchains for Maternal and Child Healthcare** is an ongoing research project aimed at creating inclusive, culturally and linguistically adapted resources for maternal and child health (MCH).  

The project focuses on standardizing medical terminology in English and Amharic, leveraging AI tools, machine translation, and expert curation to build robust multilingual resources. These resources are intended to support AI-driven health applications, digital assistants, and patient-facing tools in low-resource settings.  

The work is in progress, and the study is not yet published, so detailed findings are not publicly shared at this stage.
