## Overview
The **Interactive HateSpeech Taxonomy** project focuses on creating a **dynamic, browser-based tool** for exploring and analyzing hate speech classifications.  

Unlike static taxonomies, this interactive design allows users to:
- Expand and collapse hierarchical categories  
- Hover over nodes to view detailed definitions or examples  
- Add, edit, or delete nodes directly in the interface  
- Import and export taxonomy data in JSON format  

The goal is to provide researchers, moderators, and developers with an intuitive tool to **visualize complex relationships in hate speech categories**, support annotation workflows, and facilitate cross-platform comparisons.  

This is an ongoing research project, combining **NLP-based text analysis** with **interactive visualization** to refine and improve the taxonomy over time.
